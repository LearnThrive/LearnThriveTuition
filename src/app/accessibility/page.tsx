                We aim to meet WCAG 2.2 AA — the widely-used standard for web
                accessibility. In practice, that means we work to make sure:

                <li>interactive elements show a clear visible focus state;</li>
                <li>images have meaningful alternative text;</li>

                  the site remains usable when browser zoom or reduced-motion
                  preferences are turned on; and

                  headings, forms and page structure are marked up in a way
                  screen readers can understand.

              Accessibility is an ongoing effort rather than a one-off task. If

              please tell us — see &ldquo;Reporting an issue&rdquo; below. We
              would rather hear about a real problem directly than assume
              everything already works for everyone.
