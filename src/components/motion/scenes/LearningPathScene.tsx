/**
 * plan10.md section 5's learning-path connector, elevated by plan12.md task 5 from "a line that
 * draws in" to the site's recurring "sequential stages, spatially connected" device: the drawn
 * line now shares its actual drawing code with `SafeguardingTrustPath.tsx` (both call
 * `ScrollProgressPath`, plan11's own primitive for exactly this, rather than each keeping its own
 * near-identical inline SVG), and — the part that was missing entirely — the stage list now
 * highlights the one scroll has actually reached, so the drawn line isn't the only thing that
 * visibly changes as you scroll.
 *
 * This component owns the stage list's rendering itself (`steps` is a plain, serializable prop),
 * not a `children` render-prop: `page.tsx` is a Server Component, and a function cannot cross the
 * server/client boundary as a prop — React throws "Functions are not valid as a child of Client
 * Components" for exactly that shape, caught directly (a 500 on every request) rather than shipped.
 *
 * Still always renders the same SVG structure and the same [0,1] -> [0,1] pathLength range
 * regardless of `useReducedMotion()` — branching either on that value is what caused this file's
 * own hydration mismatch history (see the comment this replaced). `useDiscreteProgress` doesn't
 * have that problem: it starts at index 0 on both server and client and only ever updates via a
 * scroll event after hydration, so the highlighted stage can differ from the server's rendered
 * state without ever *mismatching* it.
