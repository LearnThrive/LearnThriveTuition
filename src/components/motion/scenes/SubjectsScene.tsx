/**
 * plan11.md task 9: /subjects becomes the second flagship route. Deliberately mirrors
 * HeroScene.tsx's restraint rather than inventing a bigger effect for this page — same bounded
 * background parallax via ParallaxLayer, same tier/reduced-motion gating pattern.
 *
 * The title's masked-reveal look (.heroMarkBg sweeps a green highlight in under "cover") is
 * subjects.module.css's existing `lt-mark` keyframe, unchanged here — it already runs on first
 * paint, before JavaScript, exactly like the homepage hero's identical treatment, so duplicating it
 * in Motion would only add a hydration/LCP risk for no visual gain. What's new is scroll-linked: a
 * bounded background parallax (8-20px) and a gentle fade/lift on the hero's text block as it
 * scrolls past — the whole block moves and fades together (not just the lead, the way HeroScene
 * splits headline from copy) because this page's hero is a single stacked column, not a two-column
 * split, so there is no separate "photo" layer to keep still against.

/**
 * The "section-to-section visual handoff" bullet: as a subject section becomes the one centred in
 * view, its icon badge gently scales up and settles; as the next section takes over, this one
 * recedes. Deliberately scoped to just the icon badge, not the whole section (its image/text/level
 * cards stay untouched) — a small, self-contained, bounded effect that reads the same way
 * regardless of which side of the alternating two-column layout the badge sits on, rather than a
 * connecting line or path stretched between sections that would need to bend around that
 * alternation (this page has no single fixed column the way the homepage's "How it works" list
 * does, which is what LearningPathScene's connector relies on).
 *
 * All three subject icons share ONE scroll progress source (SubjectsListScene below), not one each
 * — lib/motion/scroll.ts's useSceneProgress doc comment is explicit about this ("one scroll
 * progress source per scene... do not attach ten separate scroll listeners"), and profiling the
 * first version of this task (three independent useScene() calls, one per icon) against the
 * pre-task-9 build showed exactly the cost that rule warns about: scroll-down dropped frames on
 * /subjects went from 1.6% to 6.3%, p95 frame time roughly doubled. Deriving each icon's window
 * from one shared MotionValue (the same technique ProductStoryScene's StageDotFill already uses
 * for its six progress segments) removed that regression.
