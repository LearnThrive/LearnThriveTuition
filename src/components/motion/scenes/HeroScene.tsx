/**
 * plan10.md section 3 ("Hero becomes the flagship experience") and its "Hero scroll behaviour":
 * as the hero scrolls past, the headline moves up slightly, supporting copy fades toward ~0.6,
 * the product composition shifts on different depth planes, and the background grid moves more
 * slowly than the foreground. The CSS lt-rise entrance sequence (home.module.css) is untouched —
 * this scene only adds scroll-linked behaviour on top of the existing "assembled, not faded in"
 * load choreography, it doesn't replace it.
 *
 * The headline/copy/CTA transforms above are skipped outright on "reduced"/"light" tiers
 * (capabilities.ts): under prefers-reduced-motion nothing here should move, and on touch/narrow
 * devices plan10.md section 32 asks for smaller-scale movement rather than the full desktop depth
 * effect — "skip it" is the simplest way to satisfy that for a first pass, rather than a second,
 * smaller set of transform ranges to maintain.
 *
 * The background/product/chip layers below (plan11.md task 7) instead use the shared
 * `ParallaxLayer` primitive, which already scales its own distance by tier internally
 * (capabilities.ts's `parallaxScale`) — that's a second, independent gating mechanism from the
 * `active` boolean above, not a conflict: `active` still governs the older headline/copy/CTA
 * transforms exactly as before, ParallaxLayer governs only the layers built on it.

              `.heroFloatChip`'s own `animation: lt-rise ... both` (home.module.css) targets
              `transform`, and a CSS animation's value for an animated property wins over an inline
              style on the *same element* for as long as it holds (its "both" fill mode holds
              forever) — so putting Motion's own transform directly on `.heroFloatChip` never moved
              it. Keeping the entrance animation on the outer, unanimated-by-Motion `.heroFloatChip`
              and putting the scroll transform on a nested element sidesteps the collision entirely:
              two different elements, two different transforms, both apply. */}
