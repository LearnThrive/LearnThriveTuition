/**
 * An oversized editorial statement that wipes into view via `clip-path`, for the "1-2 high-impact
 * editorial statements" plan12.md task 3 asks for — a stronger, more deliberate arrival than
 * `Reveal`'s `mask` variant (a gentle translate-behind-a-clip-line meant for ordinary headings, not
 * a flagship statement). Only `clip-path` and `opacity` ever animate, per the plan's own rule for
 * this primitive — never layout.
 *
 * Driven by plan11's own `useInViewport` (the same activity primitive `CinematicBackdrop` uses)
 * plus an explicit `animate` prop, not Framer's built-in `whileInView` — confirmed directly, on this
 * exact setup, that `whileInView` fails to fire at all for the second-or-later page opened by a
 * given browser process (reproducible regardless of the element's position, size or viewport
 * threshold; the very first page in a fresh process works every time). `useInViewport` has none of
 * that instability anywhere else in this codebase, so this sidesteps the problem rather than
 * chasing it further into Framer/Chromium internals with no product-facing payoff.
 *
 * Same safety net as `Reveal`: Motion server-renders the *start* state as an inline style
 * (`clip-path: inset(0 0 100% 0)`), so a visitor with `prefers-reduced-motion` or no JavaScript at
 * all needs a `!important` CSS rule to see the text at all — `MaskedText.module.css`'s
 * reduced-motion block and the `(public)` layout's `<noscript>` both cover
 * `[data-masked-text-inner]` for exactly that reason. Content is plain text in the server HTML
 * either way; only its clip animates.
