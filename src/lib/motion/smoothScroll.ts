 * off" — high-refresh displays, precision touchpads whose small wheel deltas get smoothed twice,
 * broken keyboard/anchor/find-in-page behaviour, jank against sticky and pinned scenes. So it is
 * built to keep the browser's REAL scroll position (everything that reads scrollY, every
 * position: sticky, Motion's useScroll, keeps working unchanged), to apply only where it helps,
 * and to be switchable off at build time and at run time.
